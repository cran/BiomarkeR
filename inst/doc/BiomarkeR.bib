  abstract = {MOTIVATION: The discovery of new and unexpected biomarkers in cardiovascular
	disease is a highly data-driven process that requires the complementary
	power of modern metabolite profiling technologies, bioinformatics
	and biostatistics. Clinical biomarkers of early myocardial injury
	are lacking. A prospective biomarker cohort study was carried out
	to identify, categorize and profile kinetic patterns of early metabolic
	biomarkers of planned myocardial infarction (PMI) and spontaneous
	(SMI) myocardial infarction. We applied a targeted mass spectrometry
	(MS)-based metabolite profiling platform to serial blood samples
	drawn from carefully phenotyped patients undergoing alcohol septal
	ablation for hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy serving as a
	human model of PMI. Patients with SMI and patients undergoing catheterization
	without induction of myocardial infarction served as positive and
	negative controls to assess generalizability of markers identified
	in PMI. RESULTS: To identify metabolites of high predictive value
	in tandem mass spectrometry data, we introduced a new feature selection
	method for the categorization of metabolic signatures into three
	classes of weak, moderate and strong predictors, which can be easily
	applied to both paired and unpaired samples. Our paradigm outperformed
	standard null-hypothesis significance testing and other popular methods
	for feature selection in terms of the area under the receiver operating
	curve and the product of sensitivity and specificity. Our results
	emphasize that this new method was able to identify, classify and
	validate alterations of levels in multiple metabolites participating
	in pathways associated with myocardial injury as early as 10 min
	after PMI. AVAILABILITY: The algorithm as well as supplementary material
	is available for download at: www.umit.at/page.cfm?vpath=departments/technik/iebe/tools/bi},

	in the context of an interaction network obtained for genes of interest.
	Five major steps are described: (i) obtaining a gene or protein network,
	(ii) displaying the network using layout algorithms, (iii) integrating
	with gene expression and other functional attributes, (iv) identifying
	putative complexes and functional modules and (v) identifying enriched
	Gene Ontology annotations in the network. These steps provide a broad
	sample of the types of analyses performed by Cytoscape.},

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Network-based representations of biological data have
	become an important way to analyze high-throughput data. To interpret
	the large amount of data that is produced by different high-throughput
	technologies, networks offer multifaceted aspects to analyze the
	data. As networks represent biological relationships within their
	structure, it turned out to be fruitful to analyze their topology.
	Therefore, we developed a freely available, open source R-package
	called Quantitative Analysis of Complex Networks (QuACN) to meet
	this challenge. QuACN contains different, information-theoretic and
	non-information-theoretic, topological network descriptors to analyze,
	classify and compare biological networks. AVAILABILITY: QuACN is
	freely available under LGPL via CRAN (http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/QuACN/).},
